\section{Participants}
With seven hand-picked participants, the probe study remained in a more friendly and familiar context. To be sure of an initial rapport for enforcing a successful probe study, seven close friends of mine were chosen. This decision was driven by multiple factors. Participants should not be in regular contact with each other, they should be able to read, writeon a keyboard, comprehend the English language, have a working computer and have little to no prior knowledge in the field of computing. That includes not having a degree in any computer science related study course, and not having pursued programming in corporate or private projects in the long run. A small number of samples was chosen to have a better picture of the individual work and qualitative data. I chose people who are of varying backgrounds in occupation, gender, and academic levels. This opens more possibilities of artistic expression as all these factors influence different life experiences. [ref] shows the overall demographic of the participants involved. Ages of participants were not part of the picking process and coincidental.
